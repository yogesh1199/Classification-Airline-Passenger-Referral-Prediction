<B>Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction</b>

<P>
Air transport or aviation plays a very important role in the current transport infrastructure of the world and is definitely considered as the gift of the 20th century to the world. In today's fast paced world, air transport is a boon to all because of its speed. This mode of transportation is very useful for getting products quickly and safely to those who need them with short delivery times, but also allows the tourism industry in each country to grow steadily, reducing the distance between all the people living in the world.

Here, I have a dataset related to customer service ratings by various airlines. The main objective of this project is to understand how passengers will recommend airlines to others. Here the dataset is very large which initially had 131895 rows and 17 columns. On checking the data information, it was found that the dataset basically had two different types of data, 7 columns of floats 64, 10 columns of data types with object types. Coming to the null values ​​and missing values ​​in the dataset, it was observed that non-null counts do not match which clearly states that a large number of missing and null values ​​are present in the dataset.

The main objective is to predict whether passengers will refer the airline to them or not
